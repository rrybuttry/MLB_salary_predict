# A simple Model for predicting 2024 MLB Player Salaries

With the regular season wrapped up, there's one question that Major League Baseball should be asking: "How much money is Shohei Ohtani worth?" Someone's gonna pay the man some really big money in the form of a 2024 contract, but what should that number be? I've done a quick analysis to predict what his and other 2024 free agents' new salaries might look like.
